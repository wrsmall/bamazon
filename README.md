# bamazon
In this project, I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL . Bamazon deploys three different pages. On the customer page, Bamazon allows a customer to make an order, while simultaneously depleteing the stock as the user shops. The remaining two pages allow a manager to check and add inventory, as well as adding new items to the store front.
